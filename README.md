# Movies-Correlation-Portfolio-Project
Finding correlations and patterns in a set of data is a fundamental skill for Data Analysts to understand their data better and coming up with conclusions or recommendations for problems.

In this project, I have taken a Movie dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies and analyzed it to find any correlations using several techniques such as scatter plot, heatmap and grouping by.
